# Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

This work planner helps employees schedule tasks at certain hours of the work day and save them to local storage so the task is saved even if the page is refreshed. 

Using third party API's helps integrate live date presentation and versatile css functions that require less coding.

## Installation 

This project requires a coding platform such as Visual studio code for html, css, and javascript pages. Third party API's: bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js. are used to display and track present date and time and write css properties in our html to lessen writing material in our css page. 


## Usage

A user can click on a box next to the desired hour and type in a task. By clicking the save button next to it, this task is then saved to the local storage so it will remain in both the task box and local storage until it is cleared.
